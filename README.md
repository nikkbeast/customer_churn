# Customer Churn Prediction Using TensorFlow

## Overview

Customer churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses, especially in industries with subscription-based services such as telecommunications, banking, and e-commerce. This project focuses on using machine learning, specifically TensorFlow, to predict customer churn, i.e., the likelihood of customers discontinuing their subscription or service.

## Dataset

The dataset used for customer churn prediction consists of historical customer data, including various features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, transaction history, and customer churn status (target variable). The dataset is typically split into a training set for model training and a test set for model evaluation.
